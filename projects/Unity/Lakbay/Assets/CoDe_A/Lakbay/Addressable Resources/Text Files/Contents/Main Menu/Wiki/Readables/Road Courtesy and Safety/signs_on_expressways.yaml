    <space=2em>•  Keep adequate space with the long/large vehicles. Drivers need to be extra cautious when approaching and passing such vehicle. Do not pass the vehicle unless there is enough time and distance to complete the pass safely.

    <space=2em>•  Never pass a hauling truck that is turning left or right off the highway. Cargo may block all or some of the lanes.
